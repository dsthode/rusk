	cell = Rusk::Sheet[0, 0]   # get Rusk::Cell at [A1]
```

Rusk::Sheet#each

```ruby
	sheet.each do |cell|
	  # do something (cell is Rusk::Cell)
	end
```

Rusk::Sheet#each_row

```ruby
	sheet.each_row do |row|

	# when cell's value is string
	cell.value  # => "Matz"
	# when cell's value is float
	cell.value  # => 1.0
	# when cell's value is date
	cell.value  # => #<Date: 2012-01-01 ((2455928j,0s,0n),+0s,2299161j)>
	# when cell's value is enter date of time
	cell.value # => #<DateTime: 2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00 ((2455928j,0s,0n),+0s,2299161j)>
	# when cell's value is time
	cell.value # => "12:30" (string not time)
	# when cell's value is percentage(maybe application(example LibreOffice, OpenOffice) show '10%')
	cell.value  # => 0.1
	# when cell's value is boolean
	cell.value # => ture or false
```

```ruby
	cell.value = "string" # => set "string" to cell and set string to value-type
	cell.value = 1.0      # => set 1.0(float) to cell and set float to value-type
	cell.value = Date.new(2012,4,29)   # => set cell 2012-04-29 to cell and set date to value-type
